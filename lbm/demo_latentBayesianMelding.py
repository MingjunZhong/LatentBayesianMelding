####### Select a house: this is the house 2 in UKDALE #########
# This is a demo for applying Latent Bayesian Melding to energy disaggregation.
# The HES data were used for training the model parameters, and the population
# models. This demo shows how to use the LBM to disaggregate the mains readings
# of a day in UKDALE.
# Note that since HES data were read every 2 minutes, so UKDALE data were 
# resampled to 2 minutes.
# Note that all the readings were tranferred to the unit: deciwatt-hour, 
# which is identical to the unit of HES data. 
################################################################

# Note that this demo is only for a chunk (=a day).
# This should be easy to amend for all the data you want to disaggregate.
